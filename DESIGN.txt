Design
a. Our custom level brings fire and ice into the game. Where water was once a boundary, it is now a path, thanks to the snowball. Be careful, Chucks, 
a new fire enemy, will melt the effects of your snowball! The bow is acquired late in the level, allowing the player to kill Chucks and providing
a sense of progression.

b. The snowball can freeze enemies and freeze bodies of water so they can be walked across. However, Chucks negate the effects of the snowball, melting
any ice back into water, and unfreezing enemies near it.

c. The snowball fundamentally changes how water is used in the level. It is turned from a boundary to a path, and this opens up new room designs. 
Also, the player can choose to freeze enemies rather than kill them, further changing how the original dungeon is played.

d. For many rooms, the player is given the choice of either going across water, or fighting enemies. If the player chooses to not use the snowball
and avoid the water, they have to deal with enemies. However, if the player chooses to go across water, this water may be melted by a Chuck. There 
is a risk to both choices that the player must manage.

e. The player can see they have the snowball already acquired by scrolling through their B-slot weapons. Once this snowball is shot over water, the 
visual change of water to ice tells the player that they can now walk across that water.
